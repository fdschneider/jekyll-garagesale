Can you solve the problem of "The Unfair Subway?"

> Marvin gets off work at random times between 3 and 5 p.m. His mother lives uptown, his girl friend downtown. He takes the first subway that comes in either direction and eats dinner with the one he is first delivered to. His mother complains that he never comes to see her, but he says she has a 50-500 chance. He has had dinner with her twice in the last 20 working days. Explain.

This is only one of fifty puzzles that illustrate elementary and advanced aspects of probability.
