I love this car! it's spacious and comfortable. Back seats can be folded down to make a very big trunk.

Sold with new 'control technique' and inspection. No accidents. I was the second owner.


*Equipment:*

- CD Radio
- electric front windows

*Accessoirs available:*

- Solid dog grid for trunk. If bought with the car it's only €50,-.
- I am selling extra winter tires on steel wheels , used only in two mild winter seasons. Together with the car they are only €200,-.
